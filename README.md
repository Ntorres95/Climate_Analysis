#Climate Flask App

This Flask application uses various routes to call on data from a SQL database and display jsonified versions.

/api/v1.0/precipitation
/api/v1.0/stations
/api/v1.0/tobs
/api/v1.0/start and /api/v1.0/start/end

Additionally, the repo contains a jupyter notebook that obtains the data from the same database, cleans it and visualizes it.

This was accomplished using:

Flask

SQLite

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook
